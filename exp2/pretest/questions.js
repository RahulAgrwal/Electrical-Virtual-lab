    question: "Consider the following statements:<p >i. Power factor will be unity.<br>ii. Current in circuit will be maximum.<br>iii. Current in circuit will be minimum.<br>Which of these statements are correct with respect to resonance in R-L-C parallel circuit?</p>",
    answer: "i and iii only",
    options: [
      "i, ii and iii",
      "i and ii only",
      "ii and iii only",
      "i and iii only"

    reason:"i. Power Factor will be unity.<br>iii. Current in circuit will be minimum."

    question: "AC measuring instrument measures",
    answer: "rms value",
    options: [
      "rms value",
      "average value",
      "peak value",
      "none"
    ],
    reason:"AC measuring instruments measure the power used by an electrical device. RMS value is also defined as the square root of power. Hence, AC measuring instruments are used to measure the rms values of current(or voltage). "

    question: "Alternating voltage",
    answer: "varies sinusoidally",
    options: [
      "is independent of time	",
    "varies sinusoidally",
    "varies inversely with time	",
    "varies directly with time"
    ],
    reason:"Alternating current involves the current flow in the form of a sinusoidal wave. Itâ€™s direction changes with time as the sine wave."

    question: "The Q-factor of the resistance coil is _________________",
    answer: "Infinitely High",
    options: [
      "Zero",
      "Low",
      "High",
      "Infinitely High"
    ],
    reason:"The Q factor of any Coil based resonant circuit depends upon the quality of the coil; If the coil is of good quality, its resistance will be less ; Poor quality coils have more resistance"

    numb: 5,
    question: "What will happen if parallel RL connected to a DC power source?",
    answer: "Maximum current will flow through circuit.",
    options: [
      "No current will flow through circuit",
      "Minimum current will flow through circuit.",
      "Resistor will damage.",
      "Maximum current will flow through circuit."
    ],
    reason:"The current will pass through the resistor branch and the capacitor branch but no current will be there in inductor branch because capacitor acts as a short circuit when initially uncharged and open circuit when fully charged."

    numb: 6,
    question: "Without tuning circuit no _______________ would be possible",
    answer: "Communication",
    options: [
      "Oscillation",
      "Filtering",
      "Communication",
      "Amplification"
    ],
    reason:"When we connect a charged capacitor is connected across an inductor, charges flow through inductor. This sets up a magnetic field around it and thus minimizing voltage across capacitor. In this all charge will dissipate and voltage across capacitor is zero."
